# ChessBot

![ChessBot Screenshot](screenshot.png)

ChessBot is a powerful Chrome Extension designed for **Chess.com**. It integrates advanced engine analysis directly into your browser, allowing you to observe, analyze, and learn from top-tier chess engines in real-time.

## 🚀 Purpose & Vision

The primary goal of this extension is **education through observation**. 

*   **Engine vs. Bot Matchups**: It is specifically built to simulate matches between different engines and Chess.com's computer personalities (bots).
*   **Learning Tool**: By watching how high-level engines (like Stockfish 18) navigate complex positions against AI, players can improve their tactical awareness and positional understanding.

> [!WARNING]
> **STRICT FAIR PLAY POLICY**
> This application is strictly for educational purposes and for use against AI/Bots only. **DO NOT use this tool against real human players.** Using chess bots in competitive matches against humans is a violation of Chess.com's Terms of Service and undermines the spirit of the game.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Dual Engine Support**: Switch between **Local Stockfish 18** (running in your browser via WASM) and high-performance **API-based** engines.
*   **Real-time Evaluation Bar**: A dynamic, responsive eval bar that shows the advantage from the current player's perspective.
*   **Auto Play Mode**: Automatically execute engine moves with customizable delays to simulate match flows.
*   **Smooth UI**: A modern, draggable overlay panel that stays out of your way.
*   **Customizable Depth**: Adjust analysis depth to balance speed and power.
